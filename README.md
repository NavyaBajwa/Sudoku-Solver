# Sudoku-Solver

I made this sudoku solver following a tutorial to learn C. It can solve a 9x9 sudoku puzzle that is partially filled. The program reads a predefined puzzle from an array, attempts to solve it using logical rules, and prints the final solved puzzle.

## Features
- __Solving Algorithm:__ The solver uses techniques like checking rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes to determine the correct numbers.
- __Customizable Input:__ The current version includes a hardcoded Sudoku puzzle, which is used as input to the solver.

## Planned Improvements
I plan to enhance this project by allowing the program to fetch Sudoku puzzles externally. The goal is to highlight a Sudoku puzzle from an online source, and the program will automatically retrieve and solve the selected puzzle.
